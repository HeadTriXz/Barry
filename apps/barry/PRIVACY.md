# Privacy Policy
Barry (referred to as "we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose personal information when you visit our website or use our services.

## Information We Collect

We may collect certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your email address and your Discord account. This information is collected when you create an account on our website (by logging in with your Discord account), contact us, or interact with Barry.

## Automated Data Collection

When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log standard data provided by your web browser. This may include your device’s IP address, browser type and version, pages visited, time and date of your visit, time spent on each page, and technical details related to any errors encountered. This information, while not personally identifying by itself, may potentially be combined with other data to identify individuals.

## Use of Information

All data collected is used for legitimate purposes necessary to provide and maintain our services to you. We do not share your personal information with third parties unless required for the operation of our services or as legally mandated.

## Data Security

While we strive to protect your personal information, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We employ industry-standard security measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## International Data Transfers

Barry's servers are located in Germany. By using our services or providing your personal information to us, you understand and agree that your personal information may be transferred to and processed in Germany. The data protection laws in Germany and other countries may differ from those in your jurisdiction.

Where we transfer your personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection by the European Commission, we ensure that such transfers are subject to appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or other safeguards recognized under applicable data protection laws.

By using Barry's services or providing your personal information to us, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your personal information in Germany and other countries where we operate.

## Children’s Privacy

Barry's services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13, or the minimum age required by their jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we discover that a minor has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete such information from our servers.

## Your Rights

You always retain the right to have control over your personal information under applicable data protection laws. This means you can request access to the personal data we hold about you, and you have the right to review, correct, or update it if it is inaccurate or incomplete. If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, please let us know and we will take reasonable steps to correct it.

Additionally, you have the right to request the deletion of your personal data ("right to be forgotten") in certain circumstances, such as when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or if you withdraw your consent where consent was the legal basis for processing. Please note that there may be legal obligations or other compelling reasons why we need to retain your personal data.

If you choose to object to the processing of your personal data or request restriction of its processing, please understand that this may impact your ability to use certain features of our services, as some processing activities are integral to providing those services. However, we respect your choices and preferences regarding your personal information.

To exercise any of these rights, or if you have any questions or concerns about how we handle your personal data, please contact us using the details provided in the [**Contact Information**](#privacy-policy) section of this policy. Please note that we may need to verify your identity before responding to your requests.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update, modify, or revise this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on this page. It is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically for updates. Your continued use of Barry's services after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised privacy policy.
